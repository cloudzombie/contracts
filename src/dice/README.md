# dice

A traditional dice game (1-6 per dice), played with 2 dice.

## randomness

The approach is adpated from what is employed in the [lottery](../lottery/README.md), so the reader should be familiar with that.

## matching

2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 = matches the exact number
0 = 10
1 = 11
X, x = maximum (12)
:, % = snake eyes (2)
E, e = even number
O, o = odd number
= = exactly 7
> = greater than 7
< = less than 7

If nothing has specified, it will match an even dice roll (50% chance)
